LX: 101                          Horizontal size of the lattice (must be an integer)
LY: 101                          Vertical size of the lattice (must be an integer)
gd: 1                            Value of \gamma_D
gi: 2                            Value of \gamma_I
Omega: 2.01                      Value of \Omega
Max time: 30                     Maximal time at which the simulation stops (called t_{end} in the main text)
dt: 0.2                          Time step at which data is collected
num of trajectories: 1050        Number of trajectories; if set to "0" the code will run until it reads the presence of an "end.txt" file in the main folder
threshold:                       The precision threshold at which the bisection method stops in the determination of the jump probability. If empty, the default is 10^(-4)
