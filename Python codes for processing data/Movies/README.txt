This Python file reads the files where the lattice maps have been recorded and produces a sort of movie with them, showing the site-resolved evolution of one of the four average populations (S, I, B, D) over the entire lattice.

In order for it to work, please insert in line 16 the name of the folder where the "Cpp_parameters..." files are located (e.g., main folder of the C++ code) and in line 17 the folder where the "Cpp_Lattice_map..." files are (unless the code has been modified, this would be "main C++ folder/Density_Movies/".

Once this Python code is run, follow the instructions on screen.
