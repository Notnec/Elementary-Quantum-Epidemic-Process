Every time the code is run with the function PDdata_collection() three files are generated in this folder, named
  "PD_Cpp_D_by_traj_<LX>_x_<LY>_t<number of trajectories>_A1_batch<identification number>.txt"
  "PD_Cpp_Dpop_<LX>_x_<LY>_t<number of trajectories>_A1_batch<identification number>.txt"
  "PD_Cpp_SCDpop_<LX>_x_<LY>_t<number of trajectories>_A1_batch<identification number>.txt"
